# Open Data samples

This repository contains directories jupyter-notebooks.
They are intended to demonstrate some data sets produced in 
open data projects by Forum Virium Helsinki.

Note that this is still very experimental way for us to share data.

# Getting started

Clone this repository locally.

Create new virtualenv in a way that you know, e.g. with `virtualenv` command:

`virtualenv -p ~/.pyenv/versions/3.7.4/bin/python3.7 venv`

Activate virtualenv:
 
`source venv/bin/activate`

Install all required packages (jupyter-notebook, pandas etc):

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
